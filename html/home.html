       <ol> <li id="semen"> <h3> <a target="_blank" href="https://simienpark.org/">simien mountains</a> </h3>
    
    <p>Nestled in the highlands of northern Ethiopia you 
        will find the spectacular Simien Mountains.
         This jewel of an area makes you feel lost in time 
         with its remarkable rock-hewn churches and medieval castles.
          These majestic mountains seemed to have been hand-shaped
           by nature and are home to a rich cultural heritage. 
           They now draw people here to learn about ancient religious
            sites and to witness the jagged peaks and seemingly endlessstas.
             The Simien Mountains are also home to a unique but endangered
              ecosystem, complete with rare and unusual animals like the Geladan,
               Walia ibex and Ethiopian wolf.</p>

    <li><h3> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zamaniproject.org/site-ethiopia-lalibela-rock-hewn-churches.html">Rock-Hewn Churches of Lalibela</a> </h3>
    <p>Near the small town of Lalibela, there are eleven medieval churches, which are all carved out of massive slabs of volcanic rock! The churches were built in the 12th-century under the direction of King Lalibela. He had a vision of a “New Jerusalem” for Christians who were prevented from making the pilgrimage to the Holy Land because of Muslim conquests across the region. Today it is still a popular pilgrimage site for Coptic Christians. The most fascinating of the ancient churches is the House of Saint George, or Biete Ghiorgis. This church is famed for its cross-shaped design and network of trenches and ceremonial passages which connect it to the other churches. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is truly one of Ethiopia’s incredible places to visit and will leave you in awe of the faith that can move mountains.</p>

    <li><h3> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondar">gonder</a> </h3>
    <p>Nestled in the highlands of Northern Ethiopia, you’ll find the fabled city of Gondar. Once you have reached Ras Dashen, the highest peak in the spectacular Simien Mountains, you will be able to marvel at Gondar, the “Camelot of Africa”. The castle was the medieval home to Ethiopian Emperors and Princesses who led the country for nearly 1000 years. Once you have reached the main site, check out the Royal Enclosure which is home to the main attractions in the city.</p>
<p>Another site not to miss is Fasiladas’ Bath. This is where the annual Timkat celebration takes place. The water is blessed by the bishop and splashed on the crowd of pilgrims that come to renew their faith and to take part in the ceremony that replicates Christ’s baptism in the Jordan River. Whilst here don’t forget to visit Debre Berhan Selassie, which is considered to be one of the most beautiful churches in all of Ethiopia.</p>

<li><h3> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa">addisababa</a> </h3>
<p>Addis Ababa is the fourth largest city in Africa and is the diplomatic home to the African Union. This vibrant city sits atop the Entoto Mountains and has both an African and international feel. Addis has a mystical aura that seems to act like a portal to the past. It’s a place where you can explore the beautiful orthodox churches and museums</p>

<li><h3><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Nile_Falls">Blue Nile Falls</a></h3>
<p>Close to the city of Bahir Dar you will find the incredible Blue Nile Falls. The locals call it Tis- Isat Falls (translated as “Smoke of Fire”) and it is the most impressive sight on either the Blue or White Nile. The falls stretch a quarter-mile wide during the flood season and drops into a gorge of more than 150 feet deep. You can see how the falls got their name because it throws up a never-ending mist that drenches sightseers from half a mile away. The rainbows produced are awe-inspiring and creates an Eden-like perennial rainforest of lush verdant foliage. You will not be alone in this paradise; the forest is home to a wide variety of monkeys and exotically coloured birds.</p>

<li> <h3> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum">axum</a> </h3>
    <p>Head to Aksum and you will see more ancient history that you can imagine. Aksum is one of the oldest cities in all of Africa and is rich in legend and mystery. It is believed to be the home of the Queen of Sheba and the final resting place of the legendary Ark of the Covenant. Unfortunately, visitors are not allowed into the church where the Ark is said to be, but you can still check out the ancient Aksumite obelisks found in the Northern Stelae Field. The largest obelisk was recently returned to Ethiopia by the Italian government where it sat for decades after it was taken to Italy during WWII. It’s ruins and ancient legends will fascinate any lover of history. In addition to legends of Sheba and the Ark, locals believe that the roughly hewn tomb of solid rock of King Bazen was actually Balthazar, and the magi carried news of Christ’s birth to Ethiopia.</p>

       <h3> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harar">Harar</a> </h3>
       <p>On the shores of Abaya Lake in Southern Ethiopia, Arba Minch is full of natural wonder and beauty. Arba Minch in Amharic means “forty springs,” and the area is rich in many tiny springs that bubble up from the ground. You can see many of them as you hike through Nechisar National Park.

    <h3> <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danakil_Depression" width="800" height="532"> Danakil Depression</a></h3>
    <p>The Afar people call this northeastern part of Ethiopia home and against all odds, have not only existed for centuries but still have a thriving community. But beware, the climate is unforgiving and widely considered the hottest (average temp of 94F), driest (4 – 8 inches of annual rainfall) and lowest spot (400 feet below sea level) on the planet. Having said all that, this unearthly landscape is an incredible place to visit</p>

<li><h3>The People of the Lower Omo Valley</h3>
<p>The valley is dependent on the Omo River to live as it feeds the dry savannah that supports the local communities. Each of the villages has their own customs and language and have lived basically the same lifestyle for centuries. The Mursi and Hamar are proud people who adorn themselves in unusual body art and jewellery and cattle are vital to their existence. They are also very territorial and will fiercely defend their land and way of life. Even though the region is remote, many tour companies operate treks to the Lower Omo Valley and several of its villages. Just be prepared for a pricey and challenging trip–both logistically and physically.</p>
